# Homework 4 - Trulia Search Results Page

Ok team, things are starting to get real. You know layout, positing, HTML basics, responsive design, SVGs and some gradients even. You almost sound like a web developer. Almost. But now you've got to earn it with a real test: can you put all your knowledge together?

I try to select real world scenarios and this is about as real as it gets: I literally ripped a page out of trulia.com, got rid of the map and I'm handing off to you in the form of a page you can code.

## Things you should do:
* Layout the page using CSS grid and flexbox
* Figure out the right semantic structure for the document, this is hard for a complex real world site. I've helped you out a bit - check out index.html.
* Yes layout this out manually is tedious but you aren't ready for CMS stuff yet.
* Make this responsive. Phones and tablets get one column, small desktops two columns, big desktops three columns. 
* Try to do a responsive navigation structure too. Don't worry about hiding menus yet - that will come.
* Use HTML5boilerplate (https://html5boilerplate.com/) - I already gave it to you, so that should be hard to screw up ;)
* Explore HTML5boilerplate! Look at the all crazy stuff in here, what's going on? 
* Use solution.jpg in the root of this assignment to see what this should look like
