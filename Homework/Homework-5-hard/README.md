# Homework 5 - Trulia Search Results Page w/ a Modal Window

So you think you know something about absolute / relative positioning and maybe have a grasp on Javascript? Let's test your knowledge. Again, this is a another harder assignment so give it your best shot and reach out if it seems out of your reach. This assignment will require going a bit beyond what we've learned in class, but not much. You have most of the skills you need to do this but putting it all together in a production environment is a difficult step. Do your best and have confidence in yourself.

## Things you need to do:
* Use your HW4 trulia search results page as the base template for HW5
* Add a modal window on top of the page (think about what we learned with position absolute/relative)
* Design the modal window to look like our example (see solution.jpg), use flexbox.
* Use jQuery .show()/.hide() to show and hide the modal window.
* When a user clicks on any of the house pictures, make the modal window show up. What kind of selector would we use to do this (hint: what selector can you apply to multiple elements - it's just like CSS...)?
* Use jQuery .click() to capture the user's action
* When a user clicks the button in the modal window, hide the window again.
